 * Pond Agent performs operations in October installations on behalf of Pond.

 * only when it's needed and removed after it finishes its work.
 *
 * One of the design goals for the Agent is that it should consist of as
 * few files as possible, because of the complexity of filesystem operations
 * in context of nw.js.
