# PHP Deployer

This part is written in PHP and executed using the built-in PHP server. We need PHP, because SSH2 class from Node.js doesn't work in browser context (in NW.js, see DEVNOTES.md).

All requests are `POST`, regardless of whether they change the server state or not. This is done just for coding simplicity.

## Common request arguments

All methods accept arguments as JSON in the request body. These common arguments are required for all calls:

```json
{
    "privateKeyPath": "/path/to/private-key",
    "publicKeyPath": "/path/to/public-key",
    "ip": "server IP address",
    "user": "SSH user name"
}
```

## POST /deploy

Runs deployment steps:

* Checks if the server is suitable for October.
* Initializes Pond directories on the server.
* Packs and uploads the source code from the source machine to the server.
* Uploads the configuration files.
* Applies file and directory permissions.
* Runs post-deployment bash scripts.
* Initializes database from a dump, if requested.
* Saves logs and environment status file.

The deployment step does not create a database and does not configure Apache virtual hosts. This is done in another operation.

Request JSON parameters (must include the `common arguments` listed above):

```json

    "params": {
        "update": true|false,
        "projectDirectoryName": "my-project-one",

Parameters explained:

* `update` - boolean, required. Determines whether it's a create or update operation.
* `projectDirectoryName` - string, required. Project directory name on the server.
* `environmentDirectoryName` - string, required. Environment directory name on the server.
* `localProjectPath` - string, required. Path to the local project directory.
* `permissions` - object, required. Contains permission masks. Must have the following properties:
    * `directory` - string, required. Directory permission mask.
    * `file` - string, required. Files permission mask.
    * `config` - string, required. Configuration files permission mask.
* `updateComponents` - array, required for updates, ignored for new deployments. Lists components to deploy.
    * `core` - boolean, whether to update the core.

        * `value` - boolean, required. Determines whether the database should be populated or not.
        * `dump` - string, required if `initDatabase` is `true`. Contains the SQL dump string.
    * `connection` - object, required if `initDatabase.value` or `createDatabase` is `true`. Defines the database connection parameters.
        * `engine` - string, required. Specifies the database engine. Only `mysql` is supported at the moment.
        * `host` - string, reguired. Database server host name or IP.
        * `user` - string, required. Database user name. 16 characters max.
        * `password` - string, required. Database password.
        * `rootPassword` - string, required if `createdDatabase` is `true`. Defines the `root` user password for creating the database.
        * `port` - integer, required. Database server port number.
        * `name` - string, required. Specifies the database name.
* `configTemplates` - array, required for new deployments, ignored for updates. See the `/configure` operation below.
* `buildTag` - string, optional. 50 characters max. Build tag to associate with the deployment, max len: 50.
* `scripts` - array, required. Contains a list of custom scripts. Each element is an object:
    * `type` - string, required. The only value allowed is `post-deployment`.
    * `contents` - string, required. The shell script contents.

### Custom scripts

Scripts (`post-deployment`) use Twig engine for rendering. Available variables are:

* `projectDirectoryPath` - string, path to the project directory.
* `project` - string, name of the project directory, without path.
* `environment` - string, name of the project environment directory, without path.
* `deploymentEnvironments` - array of strings. Each string represents a name of the affected deployment environment (`blue`, `green` or both).

## POST /configure

Updates configuration files in a server environment.

Request JSON parameters (must include the `common arguments` listed above):

```json
{
    "params": {
        "projectDirectoryName": "my-project-one",
        "environmentDirectoryName": "production",
        "permissions": {
            "directory": "755",
            "file": "664",
            "config": "660"
        },
        "configTemplates": [
            {
                "file": "app.php",
                "template": "configuration template contents",
                "vars": [
                    {
                        "name": "var1",
                        "value": "value1"
                    }
                    ...
                ]
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
}
```

Parameters explained:

* `projectDirectoryName` - string, required. Project directory name on the server.
* `environmentDirectoryName` - string, required. Environment directory name on the server.
* `permissions` - object, required. Contains permission masks. Must have the following properties:
    * `directory` - string, required. Directory permission mask.
    * `file` - string, required. Files permission mask.
    * `config` - string, required. Configuration files permission mask.
* `configTemplates` - object, required. Defines names, content and variables for configuration files. Object keys correspond the configuration file names (`app.php`, `sms.php`, etc.). Each configuration object must have these properties:
    * `template` - text content of the configuration file with variable placeholders, see below.
    * `vars` - array containng variable names and values.

Configuration files use Twig engine for rendering:

```php
<?php

return [
    'timezone' => {{app.timezone}},
    ...
```

The configuration file templates are provided by the NW.js part of the application. In the beginning they will be fixed, but it's possible to make them editable so that each project has its own configuration file templates.

## POST /swap

Swaps active deployment environments (`blue`/`green`). The request parameters include a name of the environment which is supposed to become active, however if it is already active at the moment of the request, the request will return an error. This is done for safety, to make sure that the user UI corresponds to the server state (user sees what's really going on the server).

Request JSON parameters (must include the `common arguments` listed above):

```json
{
    "params": {
        "projectDirectoryName": "my-project-one",
        "environmentDirectoryName": "production",
        "activate": "blue|green"
    }
}
```

## POST /status

Returns status file (`/metadata/status.json`) from a project environment (see PROVISIONING-AND-DEPLOYMENT.md). Request JSON parameters (must include the `common arguments` listed above):

```json
{
    "params": {
        "projectDirectoryName": "my-project-one",
        "environmentDirectoryName": "production"
    }
}
```

The response is a JSON object string with two properties:

```json
{
    "status" => { ... status.json contents ...  },
    "active" => "blue|green"
}
```

## Design notes

All input parameters should be validated and tested as much as possible before running costly network operations. For example - configuration files and templates are rendered before the deployment starts. All request parameters are validated against a strict JSON schema.

## Security of the Pond server environments

* [ ] **TODO** - review this section

There will be a special user user with configurable name, responsible for deploying the application and running Apache (this is TBD, it's also possible Apache and the special user to share a same group instead). Project files and directories will have permissions limited to that user (or its group, TBD).

The deployment user will have the password access disabled and will use key-based authentication method.

### File permissions

File permissions are configurable by the calling code. By the recommended configuration files created by Pond are readable and writeable by the special deployment user and group and readable by other users. User can do `sudo su [deployment-user-name]` in order to update files deployed by Pond

By the recommended permission configuration, configuration files are readable and writable only by the special deployment user and its group, so that Apache can access them and other users cannot access them.
